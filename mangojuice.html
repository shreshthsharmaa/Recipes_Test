        <li>First, rinse the mangoes very well under clean water. Dry them with a clean kitchen towel. Use a sharp knife or peeler to peel the skins.

            Start at the bottom of each mango, and slice upwards towards the more narrow end to remove the skin, keeping as much of the flesh intact as possible. </li>
        <li>Next, chop the mangoes and discard the stone. To separate the flesh from the center pit, first slice large chunks off on both sides of the stone.

            Scrape or slice through the remaining flesh and place them on the chopping board. Chop these slices and scrapings into small pieces</li>
        <li>Transfer the chopped mangoes to a blender. </li>
        <li> Blend until smooth. Add a splash of water or milk (dairy or plant-based) to thin out slightly into a flowing runny juice, if you like.

            You can add a few ice cubes to make into an icy smoothie-like mango juice. Personally, I like my mango juice without anything added for the richest, creamiest and pulpy drink.</li>
        <li>Ready to serve!</li>
